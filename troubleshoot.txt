Issues encontered
After building the docker image, I tried to scan it with trivy but was getting error, related to permission and authorization. tried to solve that by adding user to docker group
but still getting the error. I did some google research and found out that according to trivy official documentation (https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.28.1/getting-started/installation/#docker), when you want scan docker image that you build locally,
you need to run this command:
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock aquasec/trivy image <<imagename>>
AND THIS SAVED MY DAY!!!
